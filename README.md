Ben's Web Utilities
===================

This repository contains a bunch of additions I wrote/collected for a couple of javascript libraries. As such they ain't the most optimized pieces of code, and you shouldn't expect any support for fancy dependency management anytime soon, but they work fine for me and might be useful for you.
Most code is written by myself. Most external pieces (usually lifted from fiddles and _stack overflow_) are marked as such.
