This plugin implements a little story that let's the user input some variables. Based on
a script found at the now defunct roflweb.de, which used window.prompt and
document.write.

Working in Firefox 3.6.10, Midori 0.2.8 (GTK Webkit), rekonq 0.6.0 (Qt Webkit), Opera 10.62.
Partially working in Chromium 7.0.536 (won't catch backspace).
