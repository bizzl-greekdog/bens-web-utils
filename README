Realizes an easy to use tag widget using an existing select box as backend, so the server side doesn't has to care wether
javascript is on or off in the client.

Note:
 When you externally change the selection inside the select box (e.g. via a script),
 you'll have to fire the custom event tagwidget.update on the changed option elements,
 e.g. like this: $(this).trigger("tagwidget.update");
